# Memory Card Game

A classic memory-testing game where players match pairs of cards. The goal of the game is to flip and find matching pairs as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## How to Play

1. Start the Game:
   - The game board consists of a grid of facedown cards.
   - Click on any card to reveal the image hidden on its front.

2. Match the Cards:
   - After flipping the first card, select a second card to find its match.
   - If the two cards match, they stay face up.
   - If the two cards don't match, they will flip back facedown after a short pause.

3. Win the Game:
   - Continue flipping cards until all pairs are successfully matched.
   - Once all pairs are matched, a "Congratulations" message will be displayed, and you’ll see the total moves taken and time spent.

## Features

- Game Grid: The game grid is a 4x4 layout of cards. (You can configure it to a 6x6 grid for added difficulty.)
- Card Matching: Match pairs of cards by flipping them two at a time.
- Move Counter: Track the number of moves it takes to complete the game.
- Timer: The game keeps track of how long it takes to match all pairs.
- New Game Button: Start a new game anytime by clicking the "New Game" button, which reshuffles the cards.
